# TeleDataCorp_Employee_Database

Dependencies

In the internal workspace's command terminal, and all seperately, you will want to type "npm" then:

- inquirer
- mysql
- console.table

These will allow user to run program. Then, when ready to use program, use the command "node employee_database.js" to begin. 

Separately, user will want to take the four .SQL files and open them in the mySQL workspace. 

Inquirer will prompt user through program. 

That is all!
