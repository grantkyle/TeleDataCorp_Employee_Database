# TeleDataCorp_Employee_Database

 ## How to use

In the internal workspace's command terminal, and all seperately, you will want to type "npm install inquirer mysql console.table", which will install all three of the dependencies in this application:

- Inquirer - a command line prompting tool
- mysql - a node driver for MySQL that allows us to access our database
- console.table - prints an array of objects in the console

These will allow user to run program. Then, when ready to use program, use the command "node employee_database.js" to begin. 

Separately, user will want to take the four .SQL files and open them in the mySQL workspace. 

Inquirer will prompt user through program. 

That is all!
